A map-based workout tracking application built with vanilla JavaScript, leveraging the Geolocation API and Leaflet.js for real-time location-based interactivity.

> All credit for the original project idea, design, and core functionality goes to Jonas Schmedtmann. This version was created as part of my learning journey through the course.
